# Indigenous for Android

An app with extensions for sharing information to micropub endpoints and reading from microsub endpoints.

This is still in alpha, so things might break.

If you want to help testing out, ping me (swentel) on one of the #IndieWeb channels on
irc.freenode.net or send me a message through my contact form at https://realize.be/contact
You need an email address connected with Google.

More information is https://indieweb.org/Indigenous
