# Indigenous for Android

An app with extensions for sharing information to micropub endpoints and reading from microsub endpoints.

BEWARE: This is still in extreme alpha, so things might break.
As soon as an alpha state is reached, we'll start deploying alpha releases.

## Current functionality:

- Login with your domain, discover indieauth, micropub and microsub endpoints.
  The microsub endpoint is currently optional
- Post a note or article with tags and picture (currently scaled to 1000x750)

## iOS
