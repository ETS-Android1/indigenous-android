# Indigenous for Android

An app with extensions for sharing information to micropub endpoints and reading from microsub endpoints.

BEWARE: This is still in extreme alpha, so things might break.
As soon as an alpha state is reached, we'll start deploying alpha releases.

## Current functionality:

- Login with your domain, discover indieauth, micropub and microsub endpoints.
  The microsub endpoint is optional so you can simply use this as a micropub 
  client too.
- Read channels and basic items in it, all items are marked unread.
- Like or reply directly on an item
- Listen to audio
- View fullscreen image
- Expose in share intents to receive text or images.
- Post a note or article with tags and picture (currently scaled to 1000x750).
- Post a like or reply.
- Syndicate.
